In order to run V0 and V1 you need to have MATLAB installed or at least the
libraries that support reading and writing from and to .mat files.

The default paths in this project are for a standard MATLAB installation.

Open the Makefile and in the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS make sure that the paths to
the static and dynamic libraries are correct and fit your installation.

/usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/extern/include : This path should be replaced with
the path to MATLAB's include files (If necessary...)

/usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b/bin/glnxa64 : This path should be replaced with the
path to MATLAB's libraries. (If necessary...)

If the include path was changed then also change it from the
include/mat_read_write.h library inside the project.

Finally this project uses openBLAS libraries which you need to install to
your machine to run properly.

Run "make all" inside the terminal to make all executables, which will       
reside inside the buid/ directory. This will produce 3 executables v0, v1
and v1_openmp

To compile the opencilk approach use the src/v1_opencilk.c source file and
your own approach, since it is apparent that there are a lot...

-To use v0 run it like this:

build/v0 corpus_set.mat corpus_variable query_set.mat query_variable k
e.g. build/v0 corpus.mat C query.mat Q 100

This will calculate the k nearest neighbors in C for each point in Q and 
produce 2 files inside the dataset/ directory:
my_idx.mat, which contains the indexes and
my_dst.mat, which contains the distances.
The mat variables need to be of double precision. 

-To use v1 and v1_openmp run them like this:

build/v1 train_set.mat train_variable k depth delta
e.g. build/v1 sift-1m.mat C 50 20000 2000

This will calculate an approximation of the k nearest neighbors in C with 
itself and produce 2 files inside the dataset/ directory:
my_idx.mat, which contains the indexes and 
my_dst.mat, which contains the distances.
The mat variables need to be of double precision.

You can calculate the recall of the results using the helper/recallCalc
program (you may need to compile it separately) or any other program of your own choosing...

CAREFUL NOTICE:

If your system has only 4GB of RAM DON'T RUN ANY OF THE ABOVE!!!
This approach is designed for 8GB systems and above and it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
to close all other memory expensive programs as you run this.
If you have less RAM contact me for further instructions.
Currently the default settings allow for a maximum of 50000 depth and 2000 delta.
Generally the bigger these numbers are the slower and more accurate the
implementation becomes.

All in all if something unexpected happens and you can't solve it please
contact me in Zulip so we can solve it together.
